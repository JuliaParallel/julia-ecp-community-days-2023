# BoF Discussion

## Questioned Asekd

* Is Distributed.jl is "right" path for HPC application? 
* How prominent are interactive use cases?


## Suggested Topics/Questions

1. What versions should we ask for from the sysadmin
2. What effort was needed to get going on each system (e.g. do you need undocumented module/environment invocations?)
3. NERSC user support experiences
4. How julia makes HPC more accessible
5. How are ECP projects going (eg. portability, productivity, regrets etc?)
6. Julia on HPC: Packaging applications into sysimage / PkgCompiler
7. Porting from X to Julia (X=Fortran â€¦)
8. Performance / compiler optimization (eg. `--check-bounds=no`)
9. Julia + MPI experiences (e.g. installing, community support, diagnosing problems) https://juliaparallel.org/tutorials/preferences/ 
10. Julia as a workflow language (FluxRM.jl?)
